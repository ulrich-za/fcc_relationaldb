This is a repository for the freeCodeCamp Relational Dababase Course.

This repository will host the 'universe.sql' file required for the completion
of the 'Celestial Bodies' sub-section.

Currently practicing on a local machine using user 'dev'.

Final project for user 'freecodecamp'
pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql
